"""Repository onboarding — assess, detect, propose (spec §18–§20, ADR-006, ADR-010).

Three phases, deliberately separate:

    assess    repository condition L0–L4 -> suggested profile
    detect    candidate providers, each citing its evidence
    propose   write .repo-governor.proposed.json -- EVIDENCE for a human to read.
              NOT a bindable manifest; see tools/onboard-interactive.py.

The engine NEVER reads the proposal. Binding requires a human to promote it
to .repo-governor.json and commit (INV-013, ADR-010 rule 1). That separation
is why silent binding is unimplementable rather than merely forbidden.

Detection is filesystem-only. It does not authenticate or probe remote
systems — a probe that succeeds because a token happens to be present is
capability implying permission, which ADR-005 forbids (ADR-010 rule 4).

# Where ADR collections live, in one place because TWO places disagreed.
#
# Detection scanned five conventions and the difficulty indicator scanned three,
# so a repository using `adrs/` or `doc/adr` was told it had "little architecture
# history" by the same run that detected its architecture provider -- and the
# indicator is not cosmetic: it raises the assessed level from L1 to L2, which
# selects the profile, which decides which roles manifest.py REQUIRES. Renaming a
# directory changed which roles a repository had to bind (issue 161).
#
# `doc/adr` is adr-tools' default and `adrs/` is common at the repository root;
# missing them reported real collections as no provider at all (#27).
#
# SPEC WORKSPACES ARE DELIBERATELY ABSENT, and this is a decision with a reason
# rather than an omission. `openspec/` and `.specify/` are both readable now --
# adapters/openspec and adapters/speckit answer for them -- so the original
# justification, that no adapter could read the evidence, has expired. The
# exclusion was re-argued on the evidence instead of being quietly flipped
# (issue 165).
#
# ADRs are decisions TAKEN: durable, immutable, superseded rather than edited,
# existing only once something has been decided. Specs are intent DECLARED,
# and a scaffold emits them before anything exists at all. Those are not the
# same fact about a repository's history.
#
# Measured with the corrected floor from issue 164, counting a spec workspace
# would move 19 of 105 OpenSpec repositories (18%) and 13 of 40 Spec Kit
# repositories (32%). The transition that settles it is GREENFIELD -> STANDARD,
# 12 repositories across both tools:
#
#     source files, median            0
#     spec/change directories, median 1   (max 3)
#     planned but unbuilt             2 of 12
#
# That population is empty repositories that ran a scaffold once. Promoting them
# out of GREENFIELD would require each to bind a roadmap_authority, which is
# §54's "blocks routine reversible implementation excessively" aimed at the
# emptiest repositories in the sample.
#
# Two things would change this answer, and both are measurable rather than
# arguable: a spec COUNT threshold behaving differently from mere presence --
# 2 of 12 is too thin to design on -- and issue 150's demand evidence.
#
# `conformance/onboarding.py` asserts the exclusion for BOTH directories, so it
# cannot lapse for one of them by accident.
