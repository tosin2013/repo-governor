"""Provider resolution and the permission chokepoint (ADR-021, implements ADR-005 rule 2).

Every adapter invocation the engine makes passes through `call()`. Nothing else
in `engine/` may spawn an adapter, and `conformance/bindings.py` asserts it by
refusing any `adapters/` path literal elsewhere in this package.

Why this module exists at all: ADR-005 rule 2 specified

    "the permission gate as a single chokepoint every adapter invocation passes
     through -- no adapter may be called except through it"

and it was never built. `engine/completion.py` spawned adapters directly, so
`permitted()` was consulted for exactly one write and for none of the reads.
The manifest was load-bearing for a single operation and decorative for the
rest. That is the gap this closes.

Three rules follow from it:

  1. The engine names ROLES, never adapters. A path literal here is a binding
     decision made in code, which is the thing INV-013 forbids.
  2. Configuration reaches an adapter from the manifest binding, never from
     engine code. `if adapter == "adapters/linear"` is the engine knowing a
     vendor, which is the abstraction leaking in the direction that matters.
  3. A denied or unbound call returns a typed envelope, not an exception
     (ADR-005 rule 5), so a permission shortfall reads as a disposition rather
     than a crash -- and never as a silent skip that makes the decision look
     complete when it is not.

Usage:  python3 engine/bindings.py <role> [verb]      explain a resolution
