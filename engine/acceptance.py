"""Show, or scaffold, the completion bar for one authority id (issue 58).

WHY. Nothing in this repository ever wrote an acceptance-criteria file. So in
every repository except this one `.repo-governor/acceptance/` is empty, and the
consequence is specific: STOP_COMPLETE is UNREACHABLE. `completion.py` answers
CONTINUE with a non-blocking NO_CRITERIA_DECLARED for every admitted item,
indefinitely, and the section 40 completion firewall -- "once acceptance
conditions are satisfied, nothing converts to execution" -- has no acceptance
conditions to be satisfied, so it never fires.

That is the product's headline behaviour. It works here because criteria were
hand-written; it worked nowhere else.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, and must never do:

  It does not invent criteria. Inferring what "done" means from an issue's
  title or body is exactly the guess ADR-018 forbids for admission signals,
  applied to completion instead. A generated criterion that looks plausible
  and is wrong is worse than an empty one, because an empty one is honestly
  NO_CRITERIA_DECLARED while a wrong one produces a confident STOP_COMPLETE.

  It does not write unless asked. Creating a file in a repository is a change
  to that repository and deny-by-default applies (ADR-005) -- the same reason
  `onboard.py --write` sits behind a flag. Without --template this only reads.

  It does not overwrite. A bar that already exists is a bar somebody set, and
  replacing it with a skeleton would be editing the bar to fit the work.

Usage:
  python3 engine/acceptance.py <id>              report what exists  (READ ONLY)
  python3 engine/acceptance.py <id> --template   write a skeleton to fill in
