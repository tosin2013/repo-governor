"""What can governance actually answer in this repository, and what can it not?

There was no way to ask. `manifest.py --validate` answers a narrower question --
do the bound adapters satisfy their declared contracts -- and returns
READY_FOR_GOVERNANCE for a binding that is correctly formed and cannot answer
anything useful (issue 51). Issue 57.

The gap is bigger than validation, because THE ROLES THAT MAKE GOVERNANCE BITE
ARE THE ONES ONBOARDING DOES NOT BIND. `engine/onboard.py` detects four of the
eight roles the schema defines. A repository can be onboarded, validate green,
and still have no decision_history -- so CAPTURE_ONLY, the default disposition,
has nowhere to record -- and no acceptance criteria -- so STOP_COMPLETE is
unreachable and every verdict is CONTINUE, forever, non-blocking.

Every one of those is the system behaving correctly. None of them is visible.

FOUR THINGS THIS IS NOT:

  Not a score. A number invites optimising the number. This prints facts and
  lets a person weigh them, the same reasoning _confirm_condition uses for
  condition indicators.

  Not a second source of truth. Everything is derived from the manifest and
  from live `describe` calls. Nothing cached, nothing restated. This repository
  has recorded three separate times that a duplicated derivable fact eventually
  disagrees with its source.

  Not silently green. If it can inspect nothing it says so and exits non-zero,
  rather than printing an empty, healthy-looking report.

  Not a gate. It reports. Nothing keys off its output, and it decides nothing.

    A repository can bind thirty ADRs and see only `bound adapters/adr answers`,
    which says nothing about whether they were read or what they mean. That
    matters more now that onboarding proposes this role when it detects ADRs
    (issue 144): people will bind something whose value was invisible.

    NOT A SCORE. `engine/status.py` refuses those, and the reason applies with
    unusual force here: a Proposed ADR is not worse than an Accepted one.
    ADR-024 is correctly Proposed pending a measurement on repositories this
    project does not own. A number would read that as debt and create pressure
    to accept decisions to raise it -- admission without authority, applied to
    an architecture ledger. Counts and named states carry the same information
    and cannot be optimised.

    The last line is the honest part. The role answers "what constrains how it
    must be built?" and no disposition consults the answer; it moves one
    thinness dimension in the compiled envelope and nothing else (issue 143).
    Saying so where an operator reads it beats leaving the binding to imply
    otherwise.
