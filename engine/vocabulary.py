"""Closed vocabularies and the blocking classifier — gate 7 (ADR-007).

Three closed sets, and the rule that decides whether an unknown stops work.

Closed means closed: an unrecognised value is a defect, not an extension
point. ADR-007 rule 1 makes the disposition alphabet engine-owned precisely
so cross-provider portability (§53) is measurable — two providers can only
be compared if the output alphabet is fixed. The same argument applies to
unknown reasons, or a provider could invent a reason the engine cannot
classify as blocking or not.

The reason set below was harvested from what the adapters and engine
actually emit, then closed around it. Adding a reason requires touching
this file, which is the point.
