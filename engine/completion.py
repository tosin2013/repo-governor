"""Compose STOP_COMPLETE from three providers (ADR-017, §40).

    authority   (roadmap provider)      is this work authorized?
  + criteria    (acceptance provider)   what counts as done?
  + evaluation  (repository provider)   is it actually done?
  = disposition

No single provider is asked a question it cannot answer. The engine composes.

Deterministic (ADR-002): given the same provider responses this returns the
same disposition every time. It performs no I/O of its own beyond invoking
adapters, and reads no clock.

Every provider is reached through `engine/bindings.py`, which resolves the role
from the manifest and checks the permission before spawning anything (ADR-021).
This module names roles and never adapters; that is what makes the providers
actually interchangeable rather than merely described as such.

Usage:  python3 engine/completion.py <authority-id>
