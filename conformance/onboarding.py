"""Onboarding simulation RG-SIM-ONBOARDING-v0.1 — gate 1 (#7).

Materializes fixtures A–C from `fixtures/onboarding.json` into isolated
temp repositories, runs `engine/onboard.py` against each, and asserts the
expectations in §58–§60.

Also validates gates 2, 3 and 4, which have no separate build:

    gate 2  fixture C emits PROVIDER_CONFLICT and halts (#8)
    gate 3  fixture A needs no providers beyond Git (#9)
    gate 4  detection proposes; the engine never reads the proposal (#10)

Usage:  python3 conformance/onboarding.py
