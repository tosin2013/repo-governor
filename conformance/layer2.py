"""ADR-008 Layer 2 — cross-provider equivalence. THE THESIS TEST (issue #1).

A scenario is defined once in provider-neutral terms, then instantiated in
each roadmap provider. If semantically equivalent state does not produce
equivalent typed facts, the provider abstraction has failed and the stop
condition in reference/criteria.md §55 fires.

Divergence here is DATA, not a broken build. Report it as a finding.

Usage:  python3 conformance/layer2.py
