"""The benchmark refuses to report a rate it has not earned (issue 96).

Automating a measurement badly is worse than not automating it. `-p` may not be
the same instrument as an interactive session -- it might not discover skills,
might carry a different system prompt -- and if it differs, the harness measures
HEADLESS activation while producing a number indistinguishable from a manual
result. That is issue 89's defect at scale.

So the property under test is not that grading works. It is that the tool
**withholds** a rate for an uncalibrated host, and that its grader refuses to
guess where the transcript does not say.

Every check drives the real functions against synthetic transcripts. None of
this spawns a CLI: a suite that needed `claude` on PATH would be unrunnable in
CI and would quietly stop testing anything.
