"""The engine's dependency surface (ADR-011 rules 1 and 4, plan item 4).

ADR-011 has said since it was Accepted: "Add a CI check asserting the engine
imports nothing outside a stdlib allowlist, and nothing network-capable." This
is that check, and it was never written.

THREE THINGS IT MUST NOT BE, each of which this repository has actually shipped:

1. **Not a grep.** `engine/envelope.py:193`, `engine/manifest.py`, `engine/
   onboard.py` and `engine/migrate.py` all import inside function bodies or on
   a comma line (`import json, sys`). A regex over `^import` misses every one
   and reports a clean engine. This walks the AST.

2. **Not satisfied by an allowlist entry.** A module may be listed and still
   not be stdlib -- adding `import yaml` and `"yaml": "we need it"` in the same
   commit would otherwise pass. Every allowed module is RESOLVED and its origin
   checked against the stdlib path, so the allowlist cannot certify itself.

3. **Not blind to the boundary the engine actually crosses.** `engine/
   onboard.py:113` does `spec.loader.exec_module(...)` on `adapters/adr`,
   loading adapter code INTO THE ENGINE PROCESS. Rule 4 explicitly permits
   adapters to carry dependencies. So the day an adapter the engine execs grows
   an HTTP client -- allowed by rule 4 -- rule 1 breaks, and an audit that
   stopped at `engine/*.py` would report a clean bill of health. This follows
   that edge.

An unaudited grant is also a failure: a module allowlisted and imported by
nothing is permission sitting there waiting to be used, and the list is
supposed to describe the engine's dependency surface, not bless a wishlist.
