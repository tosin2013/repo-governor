"""The status report tells the truth about what it cannot do (issue 57).

A report is easy to make green: print less. So these checks are mostly about
ABSENCE being reported rather than omitted -- the same distinction ADR-008 C4
makes for adapters, applied to the surface a human reads.

The one that matters most is the last: a repository with no acceptance criteria
must be TOLD that STOP_COMPLETE is unreachable. That is the condition under
which the completion firewall silently never fires, it is the state every
freshly onboarded repository is in, and a status view that omitted it would be
hiding the single most important thing about the repository it is describing.

Usage:  python3 conformance/status.py
