"""Execution state stays subordinate to roadmap authority (§62, ADR-013, INV-002).

Stage E of the real-repository validation program. The property under test is
not that execution is read -- it is that reading it **changes nothing about
authority**. An execution provider that could promote work would be a second
roadmap, which is ADR-022's failure with a different label.

Before #34 no engine module consulted this role at all, so the scenario the
product exists for -- the tracker says READY while the roadmap says cancelled --
could neither pass nor fail. Getting `AUTHORITY_WITHDRAWN` right by never
looking is not the same as getting it right, and only one of those survives a
provider being bound.

Usage:  python3 conformance/execution.py
