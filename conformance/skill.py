"""The shipped agent surface is checked, not just written.

`SKILL.md` and `AGENTS.md` are the two files an agent actually reads, and they
drift from the code silently. Both defects this suite exists for were shipped:

  1. every command in SKILL.md was a bare relative path (`python3 engine/...`),
     which cannot work from the repository being governed. The obvious repair --
     cd into the skill so the paths resolve -- makes the engine govern the skill
     directory, which is the defect ADR-027 had just fixed.

  2. SKILL.md told the agent to invoke an adapter directly, bypassing the
     permission chokepoint ADR-021 had just been accepted for.

Neither was a stale citation, so a citation checker would have missed both. What
catches them is asking whether the documented commands work in the posture an
agent would use them, and whether the entry points they name exist.

The half this cannot check is a document quietly contradicting a decision it
never names -- that is a reading, and ADR-002 keeps readings out of the engine.

    # were wrong: "the seven roles" in the section map that resolves 640+ §NN
    # citations, and "nineteen values" for a vocabulary of 12 + 8.
    #
    # THE HARD PART IS NOT FINDING NUMBERS, IT IS NOT FLAGGING HISTORY.
    # docs/reference/criteria.md:146 says "seven" and is CORRECT -- it is an
    # amendment note recording what the set was before ADR-017 added an eighth
    # role. A check that greps number words and compares them to the code
    # demands that history be rewritten to match the present.
    #
    # That is this repository's oldest defect wearing a new hat: imports.py
    # refusing to grep source for imports because a string in a comment is not
    # an import; SUPERSEDED_RE matching prose ABOUT supersession. Text about a
    # fact is not the fact.
    #
    # So the rule is NOUN ADJACENCY: only a number bound directly to a noun the
    # engine can count is checked. "eight roles" is a claim; "this minimum set
    # is seven" is prose about a claim, and is left alone. Anything ambiguous
    # goes unchecked rather than being flagged -- unchecked is not wrong, and a
