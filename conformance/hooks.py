"""The hook is exercised on real payloads, because its defects only appear there.

Two were found this way while it was being written, and neither would have
survived contact with a fixture that shared the implementation's assumptions:

  1. the disposition regex missed every real payload, because hosts nest the
     engine's stdout as an ESCAPED JSON string -- `\\"disposition\\"`, not
     `"disposition"`. The capture silently recorded `null`.

  2. worse, a null disposition fell through to a scope check that returned
     "outside declared in_scope" for every path. A real compiled envelope for a
     real GitHub issue has `in_scope: []`, so that branch produced a confident
     refusal with a fabricated reason on every write. In blocking mode it would
     have blocked all editing while stating something untrue.

The second is why this suite asserts what the hook must NOT say as carefully as
what it must. A governance tool that refuses confidently for the wrong reason is
worse than one that stays quiet.
