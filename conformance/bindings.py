"""Provider pluggability is a checked property, not a described one (ADR-021).

The provider architecture was called complete while `engine/completion.py`
named five adapters directly and spawned every one of them without consulting
`permitted()`. Documentation cannot prevent that from growing back; a test can.

Each check below fails loudly if the engine reacquires knowledge it should not
have, or if the permission gate stops being a gate.
