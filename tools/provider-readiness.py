"""Can this provider express the states the equivalence bar needs? (issue 41)

`tools/live-equivalence.py` answers issue #1 -- do two live providers normalize
to the same governance verdict. It can only answer it for states BOTH providers
actually hold, and a state present in one is counted SKIP, never agreement.

So a run can be attempted, take a live payload, and report `3 of 5, skipped: 2`
-- which fails issue 41's bar by design and tells you nothing you could not have
learned first. This asks the prerequisite: WHICH OF THE FIVE STATES CAN EACH
PROVIDER EXPRESS, AND WHICH DOES IT ACTUALLY HOLD?

THE SCENARIOS ARE IMPORTED, NEVER RESTATED. `live-equivalence.SCENARIOS` is the
single source for the five semantic states, and a second copy here would be the
defect this repository has fixed in imports.py, SUPERSEDED_RE, the census, the
reference-tier counts and ADR_DIRS -- five times, and once more the day the ADR
convention list was written out by hand.

THREE ANSWERS, NOT TWO. A status a team never created and a status that exists
with nothing in it are different facts with different fixes:

    absent     no such status -- the team must create one (or enable Triage)
    declared   the status exists and holds nothing -- put one item in it
    populated  ready

Collapsing them into "missing" is the absence-vs-unknown failure ADR-003 rule 6
forbids of every adapter, and issue 200 records the engine committing it.

TRUNCATION IS REPORTED, NOT HIDDEN. The GitHub side reads a bounded page. A
bucket absent from that page is reported as `not in the newest N`, never as
absent: `.github/project-config.json` already records this exact trap --
"gh project item-list REQUIRES --limit; without it the command returns 30 and
exit 0, so a truncated board is indistinguishable from a complete one".

Linear state arrives on stdin as an MCP payload, so no credential is needed here
or in the adapter (ADR-020, ADR-028). Nothing about the payload is written to
disk, and only status TYPE names and counts are printed -- never a title, never
an identifier (§51).

    <mcp list_issues output> | python3 tools/provider-readiness.py --github <owner/repo>
    python3 tools/provider-readiness.py --github <owner/repo> --github-only
    python3 tools/provider-readiness.py --self-test

To distinguish `absent` from `declared`, include the team's status vocabulary:

    {"issues": [...], "statuses": [<mcp list_issue_statuses output>]}

Without it every unpopulated type reports `absent-or-declared`, which is honest
and less useful.

Exit 0 when every scenario is live in both providers, 1 when not, 2 on usage.
