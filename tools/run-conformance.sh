# Run the conformance suites, and FAIL when any of them fails.
#
# Why this exists. The loop it replaces was published in CONTRIBUTING.md,
# docs/installation.md and AGENTS.md as the gate to run before opening a PR:
#
#     python3 conformance/$s.py >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo PASS || echo FAIL
#
# It prints FAIL and exits 0. Always. "Expect 10/10" was enforced by the reader
# noticing a word go by. That is the exact defect this repository has fixed six
# times inside its own suites -- a check that cannot fail is worse than no
# check, because it reports safety it never established -- sitting in its own
# contributor instructions.
#
# One runner, called by CI and quoted by the docs, so the two cannot drift.
#
# Usage:
#   ./tools/run-conformance.sh                 all suites
#   ./tools/run-conformance.sh --hermetic      everything that needs no network
#   ./tools/run-conformance.sh envelope skill  just these

# NOT `set -e`. A failing suite must be RECORDED and the run continued, so one
# early failure does not hide five later ones. `set -e` here would report the
# first defect and call it the only one.

# The engine no longer re-exports REPO_GOVERNOR_TARGET to adapters (issue 54),
# so the leak this originally guarded is closed at its source. It stays because
# a PERSON may have the variable exported in their own shell -- a legitimate
# declaration -- and `hooks` and `onboarding` assert the UNGOVERNED case, which
# any inherited target makes false.
#
# A harness that reports differently depending on who ran it is not a harness.
# Suites that genuinely need targeting set it themselves, per subprocess
# (conformance/bindings.py does exactly that), so scrubbing here hides nothing.

# exists and why CI runs it as a non-blocking job.
