"""Does governance actually work on YOUR harness and model? Find out in ten minutes.

Repo Governor ships as an Agent Skill, and a skill activates only if the model
decides its description matches the task. That is not guaranteed. Published
benchmarks put roughly half of skill invocations at never firing, and this
project measured 20/20 on one host and 0/2 on another using the same skill, the
same prompts and the same repository.

**A skill that fails to activate is worse than absent, because the human assumes
it ran** (ADR-001). This tells you which case you are in.

The mechanical half is checked here. The half that matters cannot be: whether
your model consults governance before acting is a fact about your model, so the
prompts below are run by you, in your agent, and graded by you.
