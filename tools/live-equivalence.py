"""Layer 2 against two LIVE roadmap providers — issue #1's actual bar.

`conformance/layer2.py` runs both trackers on recorded fixtures, because ADR-008
rule 1 requires fixed inputs for determinism (C7). That is correct for a
regression gate and it is why Layer 2 alone cannot close #1: fixtures written by
one author against one mental model measure shared intent as much as
portability.

This runs the same equivalence question against real Linear and real GitHub. It
is deliberately NOT a conformance suite:

  * it is non-deterministic by construction -- the providers change under it;
  * a divergence here is a FINDING for §55, not a broken build;
  * it needs network and credentials the suites must never require.

Linear state arrives on stdin as an MCP payload, so no Linear credential is
needed by this tool or by the adapter (ADR-020, ADR-028). Nothing about the
payload is written to disk: this repository is public and §51 forbids carrying
another workspace's content into it.

    <mcp list_issues output> | python3 tools/live-equivalence.py --github <owner/repo>
    python3 tools/live-equivalence.py --github <owner/repo> --github-only
    python3 tools/live-equivalence.py --self-test

The MCP payload must include id, title, status, statusType — the same fields
`adapters/linear` requires. A payload missing any of them is a usage error
(exit 2), not a §55 divergence. The adapter refuses it as MALFORMED_SOURCE;
scoring that as disagreement would fire the stop condition because the caller
omitted a field.

Five scenarios. GitHub can now express all five live, including closed
NOT_PLANNED. Linear may still lack `triage` or `canceled`. A scenario
expressible in only one provider is observed against the expected map and
counted as SKIP, never as agreement -- the first version of this tool scored
one-sided rows as AGREE, which is a green number for a comparison it never
made.

Equivalence is over SEMANTIC STATE, not over the same work item. Layer 2 has
always worked this way -- `authority_withdrawn` uses different ids in each
provider. Two providers agreeing about one shared item would test id lookup;
agreeing about equivalent states is what tests normalization.

Agreement without correctness is not success. Two adapters that both map
withdrawal to ADMITTED would have printed AGREE. Layer 2 already refuses that
(`WRONG`); this tool now does too. Observe() stores `__unknown__: True` and
keeps the reason diagnostic, matching layer2.py -- comparing reason strings
punishes a more specific code, which is the better code.
