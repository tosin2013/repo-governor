"""Deterministic governance delivery for coding-agent hooks (ADR-029).

One script, three hosts. Reads a hook payload as JSON on stdin, writes a
host-shaped decision as JSON on stdout. Exit 0 always, except where a host
requires exit 2 to block (see `--exit2-on-deny`).

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO
---------------------
It never decides authorization. `engine/completion.py` is the only thing that
produces a disposition (ADR-002), and it requires an authority id that a raw
user prompt does not have. So this hook delivers the *requirement*
deterministically and reports verdicts the engine already produced. It does
not compute one, and it does not guess an authority id from prompt text --
that would be a second authority surface, which ADR-022 forbids.

THE THREE MOMENTS
-----------------
  prompt   before the agent reasons   inject the governance requirement
  write    before a file is changed   check it against the compiled envelope
  capture  after the engine is run    remember what authority this session holds

`capture` is what makes `write` possible. A session acquires an authority by
the agent actually running the engine -- which is the behaviour we want anyway.

Usage:
  governance-hook.py <moment>            moment: prompt | write | capture
  governance-hook.py <moment> --exit2-on-deny
