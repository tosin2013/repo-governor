"""Ask the questions detection cannot answer, and emit a manifest that validates.

`engine/onboard.py --write` produces a CANDIDATES document: what was found on
disk, with evidence, and `PROVIDER_UNCONFIRMED` wherever it would have to guess.
That file is evidence, not a manifest -- renaming it yields
`UNSUPPORTED_VERSION: manifest version None`, which was the documented
instruction until 2026-08-19 and had never been run end to end.

The gap is not ceremony. A manifest declares **which provider is the roadmap
authority and what signal means admission** (ADR-018), and neither is visible on
the filesystem. Whether admission means a milestone, a label or a project column
is a fact about how a team works. Detection must not guess it; a person can just
say it. So: ask.

Nothing here binds. Output is `.repo-governor.proposed.json` in manifest shape,
which a human reviews and renames. The engine never reads a proposal, which is
why silent binding stays unimplementable rather than merely forbidden.
