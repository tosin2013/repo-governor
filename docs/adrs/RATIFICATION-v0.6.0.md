# Architecture Ratification Review — v0.6.0

**Prepared** 2026-09-04 · **Not ratified.** The acceptance line at the end is the
maintainer's to write (§68). Everything above it is evidence, and evidence is not
a decision.

## Why this review exists

v0.5.0 shipped under a recorded departure from the release condition, and that
review said what shipping it again would mean:

> A departure recorded once is an exception; recorded every release, it is the
> condition being repealed by habit.

v0.6.0 is that second release. This document exists so the second departure is
recorded deliberately rather than inherited by silence — the failure mode the
sentence was written against.

## Method

Unchanged from v0.1.0 and v0.5.0, and reproducible:

- **Runtime dependency** — is the ADR cited by `engine/`, or by an adapter this
  repository actually binds? Unbound adapters ship but govern nothing here.
- **Its own acceptance conditions** — what does the ADR say would settle it, and
  is that true today? *This is the half a count would skip.*

```bash
# the derived set, by the record's own method
python3 conformance/skill.py | grep -i proposed

# did the ADRs themselves move since the last release?
git diff --stat v0.5.0..HEAD -- docs/adrs/031-*.md docs/adrs/033-*.md
```

## The ledger

Six ADRs are `Proposed`. Two are runtime-dependent:

| ADR | cited by | own conditions |
|---|---|---|
| **ADR-031** | `engine/manifest.py`, `engine/status.py` | 0 of 4 met |
| **ADR-033** | `engine/onboard.py` | 1 of 3 met |

**ADR-020, ADR-029, ADR-030, ADR-032** — held cleanly, no engine or
bound-adapter citation. Undisturbed by this release.

## Findings

### G1 — The set did not grow, and that is a measurement rather than luck.

v0.6.0 bound an eighth adapter (`adapters/decision-history-file`). The bound
surface the derivation reads therefore grew, and the runtime-dependent
`Proposed` set stayed at exactly {031, 033}. The guard added after #153 and #183
is doing the work it was added for: the set is recomputed from the code on every
conformance run rather than asserted in prose that goes stale.

### G2 — Neither ADR moved. Verified, not assumed.

`git diff v0.5.0..HEAD` over both files is empty. ADR-031 still says *"`Proposed`
until all four are met. None is met today."* ADR-033 still meets 1 of 3.

Nothing in v0.6.0 was aimed at either, and nothing in v0.6.0 disturbed either.

### G3 — ADR-033's condition 3 is measurably worse than at v0.5.0.

Condition 3 asks that the `get_provenance` gap be resolved *"one way or the
other — either an engine consumer reads it, or §12 drops it"*, and states the
harm: *"while seven adapters implement a method nothing calls, a reader is
entitled to assume provenance is carried when it is not."*

Measured across the two releases:

| | bound adapters | of those, implementing `get_provenance` | engine callers |
|---|---|---|---|
| v0.5.0 | 7 | 4 | **0** |
| v0.6.0 | 8 | **5** | **0** |

Binding `adapters/decision-history-file` added a fifth bound implementer of a
method no engine module calls. The condition did not merely fail to advance; the
gap it names is one wider. That is small, and it is in the wrong direction, and a
review that reported "unchanged" would have missed it. **#222** is open on
exactly this gap and is unmilestoned.

### G4 — F3 is no longer a structural prediction. It is the operating state.

The v0.5.0 review set out three readings of the conflict and declined to choose:
the condition is right and the dependency is the problem; the condition is right
and a departure is the honest exception; or the condition needs amending. It
named the cost of the third: *"a condition amended the first time it binds is a
condition that never binds."*

A year of releases is not required to see which reading is being adopted in
practice. Two consecutive releases have taken reading 2 without anyone choosing
it, which is how reading 3 arrives without an ADR — the condition stops binding
because it is departed from routinely, not because anyone amended it.

**#223** is open to settle this and is unmilestoned. It has now been open across
one full release cycle.

## What ratification requires of the release, not just of the ADRs

The release condition has two halves, and only the first is contested:

> Every architecture decision the runtime depends on is Accepted, **and no
> Proposed ADR is silently treated as normative by that release.**

The second half is met. `docs/adrs/README.md` names the set; `conformance/skill.py`
derives it from the code and fails if any document claims the runtime depends on
none of them; `docs/releases/v0.6.0.md` states the departure and quotes the
warning. Nothing here is silent.

The first half is not met, for the second consecutive release.

## What is left to the maintainer

Four things this document deliberately does not do:

1. **Choose among F3's three readings.** That is #223, and it is an ADR-shaped
   decision with its own acceptance conditions (ADR-032), not a line in a review.
2. **Ratify ADR-031 or ADR-033.** Neither meets its own terms, and accepting a
   decision whose stated conditions are unmet would make the conditions
   decorative.
3. **Admit #222 or #223.** Admission is declared, never assumed (ADR-018), and
   both were filed by the agent that found them.
4. **Accept or refuse this departure.** A second departure is defensible on the
   record — the set has not grown, the disclosure is complete, and the blocking
   evidence is not on a timeline this project controls. It is defensible *once
   more*. The line below is where that judgement goes.

## Maintainer's acceptance

*Unsigned. §68: ratification is a human act, and an agent that signs this has
ratified nothing.*
