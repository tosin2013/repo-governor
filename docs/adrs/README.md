# Architectural Decision Records — Repo Governor

Generated 2026-08-17 from PRD v0.2 (provider-oriented draft) using the MCP ADR Analysis Server's PRD-to-ADR protocol, informed by the external landscape research in [`../research/2026-08-17-external-landscape.md`](../research/2026-08-17-external-landscape.md).

**21 of 24 ADRs are Accepted** as of 2026-08-17, ratified under [RATIFICATION-v0.1.0.md](RATIFICATION-v0.1.0.md). ADR-020 and ADR-024 are held `Proposed`; ADR-014 is `Superseded` by the 023/024 split. Per §61, the project cannot reach `IMPLEMENTATION_READY` until the `RG-SIM-ONBOARDING-v0.1` simulation passes.

> **`PRD.md` no longer exists.** Its normative content was extracted into [`../reference/`](../reference/) on 2026-08-17, with original § numbering preserved so every citation below still resolves. Start at the [section map](../reference/README.md#section-map).

012 (untrusted input) — cross-cutting, constrains 003, 004, 009, 010
015 (JSON manifest) — resolves 011's deferred choice; unblocks gate 5
016 (MCP transport) — constrains 003; engine never calls MCP directly
017 (acceptance artifact) — adds 8th role; unblocks gate 7, fixes #2 root cause
009 (evidence chain) — depends on 002, 004; enables INV-005, INV-008
```

Read 001 and 002 first. They are the two decisions everything else assumes.

## What changed relative to PRD v0.2

The ADRs are not a restatement. Six things are settled, added, or contradicted — all four textual changes are now folded into [`../reference/`](../reference/):

1. **Delivery form decided (001).** PRD v0.2 listed MCP, hooks, IDE, and CI as undifferentiated future candidates. Agent Skills becoming a 26-platform open standard on 2025-12-18 makes skill-first the tool-independent choice rather than a vendor bet. §65 updated.
2. **Determinism made binding (002).** The invariants read as prose. An agent that reasons past prose is the documented April 2026 failure. Invariants become executable predicates; `SKILL.md` documents the code rather than carrying the rule.
3. **New ADR with no PRD basis (012).** §51's security model did not address prompt injection, yet every input is text third parties can write. §51 amended with the missing bullet.
4. **§21 inconsistency resolved (013).** The manifest sketch treated some roles as lists and others as scalars without saying why. ADR-013 makes cardinality a rule derived from whether a role answers "is this authorized?" §21 annotated.
5. **A live stop condition identified.** Beads issue #1150 requests plugin-based tracker integrations. If delivered, it overlaps the provider-abstraction thesis. §55 now tracks it as a concrete input rather than an abstract risk. Current assessment: Beads federating trackers makes it a better `ExecutionStateProvider`, not a competitor, because it aggregates state without ruling on authority.
6. **Differentiation confirmed.** No tool in the spec-driven-development or tracker categories answers "is this work currently authorized?" across providers. OpenSpec and Spec Kit answer *how to build*; none reconciles a spec against a withdrawn roadmap item. The §56 differentiation candidate survives the sweep.

## Open questions

These are not deferred decisions — they are things no one can answer yet without evidence.

| # | Question | Where it bites | Resolved by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ~~1~~ | ~~Manifest canonical format~~ — **resolved by [ADR-015](015-json-as-canonical-manifest-format.md)**: JSON canonical. Spike showed a 143-line YAML subset silently mis-types 7/10 realistic values. | 011, 004 | ✅ [#3](https://github.com/tosin2013/repo-governor/issues/3) closed |
| 2 | Decision-record redaction default for public repositories | 009, 012 | Design decision before v1 |
| 3 | Does cross-provider semantic normalization actually work? | 003, 008 | ADR-008 Layer 2 with two real providers — **this is the thesis test** |
| 4 | How thin are compiled ScopeEnvelopes on real roadmap items? | 014 | Measurement across real repositories |
| 5 | Skill activation reliability across hosts | 001 | 20-prompt activation test on 3 hosts |
| 6 | Monorepo / per-package governance | 004, 006 | Deliberately deferred past v1 |

Questions 3 and 4 are the ones that could invalidate the product. Both should be answered early, while changing course is still cheap.

## Path to IMPLEMENTATION_READY

[§61](../reference/onboarding.md) lists seven gate conditions. Current coverage:

| Gate condition | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Onboarding simulation passes | ✅ **Met** — `completion.py GATE-1` → `STOP_COMPLETE` | [`conformance/onboarding.py`](../../conformance/onboarding.py) **29/29**, `RG-SIM-ONBOARDING-v0.1: PASS`. Fixtures A–C materialized into isolated temp repos |
| 2. Provider conflicts handled deterministically | ✅ **Met** — `completion.py GATE-2` → `STOP_COMPLETE` | Fixture C raises `PROVIDER_CONFLICT` on `roadmap_authority`, names both candidates, applies no ranking |
| 3. Low-complexity repos need no extra providers | ✅ **Met** — `completion.py GATE-3` → `STOP_COMPLETE` | Fixture A detects only `repository`; condition L0; state `AUTHORITY_SOURCE_MISSING` |
| 4. Detection does not assign authority | ✅ **Met** — `completion.py GATE-4` → `STOP_COMPLETE` | Proposal written to `.repo-governor.proposed.json`; asserted the manifest loader never reads it; binding requires human promotion |
| 5. Manifest semantics stable | ✅ **Met** — verified by `engine/completion.py GATE-5` → `STOP_COMPLETE` | `schemas/manifest-v1.json` frozen; `engine/manifest.py` fails closed; [26/26 refusal cases](../../conformance/manifest.py); `--validate` reaches `READY_FOR_GOVERNANCE`; `engine/migrate.py` stub exists per ADR-004 step 5 |
| 6. One viable adapter per required core role | ✅ **Met** — verified by `engine/completion.py GATE-6` → `STOP_COMPLETE`, not by assertion | All 9 adapters pass [Layer 1](../../conformance/layer1.py) **112/112**; [Layer 2](../../conformance/layer2.py) 9/9 EQUIVALENT across 3 roadmap providers; criteria in `.repo-governor/acceptance/GATE-6.json` |
| 7. `UNKNOWN` and failure behavior defined | ✅ **Met** — `completion.py GATE-7` → `STOP_COMPLETE` | [`engine/vocabulary.py`](../../engine/vocabulary.py) closes 12 governance + 8 onboarding dispositions and 18 reasons; [`conformance/vocabulary.py`](../../conformance/vocabulary.py) proves the sets cannot drift from the code |

**All seven gate conditions are met**, each on `engine/completion.py`'s verdict rather than assertion. Per §61 the specification may move to `IMPLEMENTATION_READY`.

Reproduce the whole thing:

```bash
for n in 7 8 9 10 11 12 13; do python3 engine/completion.py $n; done   # GitHub issues, live
for s in layer1 layer2 transport manifest onboarding vocabulary bindings; do python3 conformance/$s.py; done
```

The gate ids are GitHub issue numbers, not `GATE-N`. They were file-roadmap ids until ADR-022 moved the roadmap of record to GitHub.

### What `IMPLEMENTATION_READY` does not mean

The gate asks whether the architecture is stable enough to build on. It does not ask whether the product is worth building, and four things remain open:

* ~~**All 22 ADRs are still `Proposed`.**~~ **Resolved 2026-08-17.** 21 of 24 Accepted; ADR-020 and ADR-024 deliberately held. See [`RATIFICATION-v0.1.0.md`](RATIFICATION-v0.1.0.md).
* **#1 (cross-provider normalization) has weak evidence.** 9/9 scenarios agree, but all three adapters were written by the same author against the same map — that measures shared intent as much as portability. A third-party adapter is the real test.
* **#2 (envelope thinness) is not merely unmeasured — it is unanswerable as written.** ADR-014's envelope compiler was never built, so nothing compiles an envelope whose thinness could be measured. Found by the ratification sweep.
* **The criteria-drift weakness is unresolved.** Acceptance criteria were amended twice during implementation. Both amendments were justified and recorded, and nothing but that record distinguishes a legitimate correction from a convenient one.
