"""Shared adapter-protocol helpers for the Python adapters (ADR-003).

A Go or shell adapter would not import this — the protocol is the JSON on
stdout, not this module. It exists only to keep the Python adapters short.

Wire protocol
-------------
    $ADAPTER describe                       -> capability manifest
    $ADAPTER query <role> <function> [k=v]  -> typed response (read)
    $ADAPTER write <role> <function> [k=v]  -> typed response (mutate)

`query` and `write` are separate verbs so the read/write split ADR-005 cares
about is visible at the protocol level rather than buried in a function name.
An adapter that declares no writers rejects `write` outright. The ENGINE still
checks the manifest before calling either -- an adapter offering a writer is
capability, not permission (INV-014).

Every response is a single JSON object on stdout. Exit code 0 means "the
adapter ran"; it does NOT mean the query succeeded — check `ok`. This split
exists because ADR-008 requires an unreachable backend to produce a typed
failure rather than a plausible-looking empty result.

Determinism note (ADR-002): adapters do not stamp timestamps into provenance.
The engine stamps the decision record. Timestamps here would break the
byte-identical replay that ADR-009 depends on.

    `capabilities` are claims that MUST be exercisable by a conformance probe
    (ADR-008 C2). `properties` are declarative traits that cannot be probed —
    persistence, provenance quality. Keeping them apart is what makes an
    honest-advertisement check meaningful rather than vacuous.

    `transports` maps a transport name to the capability set that transport can
    serve, for `describe --transport=<name>`. A capability set is a property of
    (provider x transport), not of the provider alone (issue #17). Omit it when
    every transport offers the same set, and say so rather than implying variance
    that does not exist.

    `writers_probe` gates the WRITE half separately. A reachable transport is not
    necessarily a writable one -- a read-only Dolt database is readable and
    advertising `record_decision` against it is the same dishonesty as
    advertising reads against an absent one.

    `probe` is a zero-arg callable returning whether the transport is usable.
    When it returns false, `describe` advertises NO capabilities. This follows
    LSP's rule that a missing property means absence of the capability: an
    adapter that cannot reach its backend can serve nothing, so it must claim
    nothing. Without this an unconfigured adapter advertises capabilities it
    will fail every query for (issue #17).
